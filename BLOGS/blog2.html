            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back, my childhood in the province wasn't just good; it was a constant, delirious high of happiness. I remember running through the fields behind my Lola’s house, my chest bursting with laughter that felt like it would never end. The world was a playground built specifically for me. If I scraped my knee, Lola was there with a warm hand and a sweet treat to make the pain vanish. We didn't have much, but I didn't know that. I thought we were rich because I had the sun, the mud, and the endless energy of being young. I truly believed that life was just one long game of <em>patintero</em>, where even if you got tagged, you could always just start over.

            </div>

            <h2>Body</h2>
            <p>
                That era of my life feels like a vivid, technicolor dream now. I remember the afternoons spent waiting for the sound of the <em>sorbetero</em> bell, believing that a scoop of cheese ice cream on a stale bun was the peak of culinary luxury. I remember catching spiders in matchboxes and feeling like a beast tamer, or lying on the bamboo floor while the electric fan hummed a lullaby, convinced that the only job I would ever have was to be happy. I never saw the bills piling up on the table. I never noticed the way the adults whispered about rice prices or harvest yields. I was insulated in a bubble of pure joy, protected by my elders who silently absorbed the blows of the world so I wouldn't have to feel them.
            </p>
            <p>
                But growing up is a slow, painful process of waking up. Now that I am in college, the bubble has not just popped; it has been shredded. The silence of the province has been replaced by the frantic noise of deadlines and the hum of my laptop fan at 3 AM. I sit here, staring at lines of code or endless pages of readings, and the clarity is suffocating. I finally understand the value of money—not as a concept, but as a terrifying reality. I catch myself calculating the cost of my meals against my allowance, realizing that the "simple life" I enjoyed was paid for by the sweat and sacrifice of people I never properly thanked.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world isn't soft anymore. It's a jagged place of expectations and performance. There are no "cupcakes and rainbows" here; there is only the pressure to succeed, the fear of failure, and the realization that mediocrity is a death sentence in this economy. I used to think stress was just being called on in class; now I know it as a physical weight that sits on my chest when I try to sleep. The colorful imagination that once turned shadows into monsters has been repurposed to imagine worst-case scenarios for my future. I am learning, painfully, that comfort is expensive, and peace of mind is a luxury I can no longer afford.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                I often close my eyes and try to go back to that backyard, to the smell of Lola’s cooking and the feeling of grass under my feet. I want to tell that little kid to run slower, to laugh louder, to hold onto that moment with a death grip.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because once you learn that the world isn't fair, once you see the strings holding up the scenery, you can never unsee them. I am building a future, yes, but I would give anything to go back to the days when I didn't know how much that future cost.
            </p>
