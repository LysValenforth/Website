            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
               I confess and admit to the fact that I am guilty of cheating on my oldest, most trusted friend. And at this moment it feels as though I've committed a serious offense. Right now (at 11:32 PM), there is complete silence everywhere but the steady hum of the electric fan I'm sitting beside. I've had two cups of coffee so far tonight; I used that 3 in 1 Mix coffee because I needed something to keep my eyes from closing completely. On the other side of me is an empty yellow pad of paper; I can see it looking at me as if to say... “write your assignment for tomorrow.”
            </p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>The Body</h2>
            <p>
               In order to realize why this experience is so wrong for me, you need to look at where I came from. The day I was tall enough to get to a keyboard in a store (the first time) was when I started using Google as an extension of myself. That is to say we grew up together. For years, Google was the way I accessed Y8.com (games), a method to figure out the Redstone tutorials in Minecraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the honeymoon phase will eventually come to an end, I noticed the first signs of distress within my new relationship while working on a significant research project during SHS specifically Grade 12. During this time, I requested a quote from my AI "friend" along with a reference (source) to support my argument.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Now where do I stand with all of this? I'm in a toxic relationship between two forms of technology - a digital love triangle. I may be considered a cheater for using them both at the same time. However, being real here, AI is going to be around forever.
